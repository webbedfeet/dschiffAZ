# Why would you want to use R Markdown


## My Coding Background

* Started coding in university ~5 years ago
* My code tended to be messy and unorganized
* A Professor Suggested R Markdown


## The Basics of R Markdown (part 1)

1. Workflow
   + R Markdown is a dynamic report used to embed R code into documentations
2. Open File
   + Open files via File-> New File -> R Markdown
3. Markdown
    + Using the markdown text, a report will generate

## The Basics of R Markdown (part 2)
4. Choose Output
    + YAML ~~yet-another-markdown--language~~ header explains how the document will be built
5. Embed Code
   + Embed code that to generate output and renderings
6. Render
    + Build rendering in final report TLFs


## Open File
+ Open files via File-> New File -> R Markdown
+ Select from the pop-up window
+ Click OK

## Markdown
* Syntax
    + " * * " or " _ _ " = *word* or _word_

    + Superscript x^2^
    + Strikethrough ~~strikethrough~~
    

## Choose Output
* YAML
    + PDF
    + Word Docx
    + HTML
